I tried to build a model that predicts the covid cases in the US based on time and locations

Since the number of variables were too many, the time for the Hyper parameter tunning took over 23 hours.

So, I have skipped for the Hyper parameter tunning part.

Additionally, the trend of covid cases has been chaning. So, new model such as quardrating linear regressions should be considered in cases of predicting covid cases in different period.

Although the auccuracy were above 80%, I think it would be better to have included other independent variables such as humiditiy and regulation strictiness.
